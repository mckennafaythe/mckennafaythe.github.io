        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <h3>Clek Inc.</h3>
        <div class="blockLink"><a href="https://www.clekinc.com" target="_blank">clekinc.com</a></div>
        <img src="images/clekmobile.jpg" alt="Clek webpage. A woman on a front doorstep, carrying an infant carseat while looking back at her other two children">
        <p>The Clek mobile site uses white space and clean design by leaving ample space between elements in the header, as well as between the text and buttons in the main body of the page. Clean design is shown again in the simplistic use of color.</p>

      <section id="repetitionCol"><h2>P.A.R.C. Repetition</h2>
        <h3>Discover</h3>
        <div class="blockLink"><a href="https://www.discover.com/" target="_blank">discover.com</a></div>
        <img src="images/discovermobile.jpg" alt="Discover webpage. Smiling woman with long, brown hair wears a headset in an office setting. White text reading 'welcome to Discover' overlays her torso">
        <p>Repetition is seen in Discover's mobile site through their use of color and box shapes. The site is easier to navigate because the repition of orange points you to where you'd like to click.</p>

      <section id="hicksCol">
        <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
        <h3>YouTube</h3>
        <div class="blockLink"><a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">youtube.com</a></div>
        <img src="images/youtubemobile.jpg" alt="Youtube webpage. Dark-haired woman glances slyly to the side. White text reading 'cursed princess club' overlays the image. Below, animated horses are collected in a corral with 3, green trees surrounding them">
        <p>Hick's Law argues that more choices = more time to decide, and in turn, the possibility to not make a decision at all. Youtube's full site has many options, but they did a great job of narrowing it down to a bar of 4 at the bottom. Concisely displaying the most important links makes this site more user-friendly.</p>
