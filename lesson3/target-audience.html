            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>The audience for Clear Forecasts will be between ages 25-40, both male and female, reside in Idaho – or travel to Idaho – and will access the site on primarily mobile devices. </p>

            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <h3>Claire</h3>
            <p>Claire is 27, is single, has a Bachelor’s degree in education, and works for a school that relies heavily on outdoor-based learning. To prepare herself, her class, and plan the week’s activities, Claire wants a mobile site that can provide accurate, up-to-date weather forecasts. With all the time she spends planning for her classes, Claire doesn’t want to spend excess time also planning for the weather, so a website that simply displays the forecast and the time it was updated is most important to her.</p>
            <h3>Jacob</h3>
            <p>Jacob is 33, is a Marriage Counselor, is married with 3 children, and is an avid turkey hunter. Jacob doesn’t care much for knowing the weather, as he is primarily inside with his job, but when the season comes around, he likes to know what to expect while he’s out hunting and wants to be able to check it on his mobile device. He really only wants to check the weather on the select weekends he’s away, so the challenge with Jacob is to see if Clear Forecasts could be a website he’d use more than a month or so out of the year.</p>
